##### Partitioning around mediods

           cbind(rnorm(15,5,0.5), rnorm(15,5,0.5)))

###### Heirarchial clustering

library(cluster)

## violent crime rates by US state

###### k-Means clustering

library(graphics)

# a 2-dimensional example
x <- rbind(matrix(rnorm(100, sd = 0.3), ncol = 2),
           matrix(rnorm(100, mean = 1, sd = 0.3), ncol = 2))
